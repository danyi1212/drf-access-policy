# Policy for Function-Based View

You can also use policies with function-based views. The action to reference in your policy statements is 
the name of the function. You can also bundle multiple functions into the same policy as the example below shows.

```python hl_lines="4 9 18 25"
class AuditLogsAccessPolicy(AccessPolicy):
    statements = [
        {
            "action": ["search_logs"],
            "principal": "group:it_staff",
            "effect": "allow"
        },
        {
            "action": ["download_logs"],
            "principal": ["group:it_admin"],
            "effect": "allow"            
        }
    ]


@api_view(["GET"])
@permission_classes((AuditLogsAccessPolicy,))
def search_logs(request):
    ## your logic here...
    pass


@api_view(["GET"])
@permission_classes((AuditLogsAccessPolicy,))
def download_logs(request):
    ## your logic here...
    pass
```
